            Slow-made flowers from a small home studio
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Craftora began with a simple thought — flowers are the sweetest gift, but they
            fade far too quickly. So we started weaving them from wool instead. What
            started as one bouquet for a friend became @craftora07, a little studio where
            every order is still made by hand, one petal at a time.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Each bouquet takes days to finish, uses no plastic stems or glue-heavy
            shortcuts, and arrives ready to gift. When you order from Craftora, you're
            supporting slow, handmade craft — and gifting something that truly lasts.
